### Contributing
Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute. Many developers have helped make the 'Titiksha' what it is today. There are several ways you can help out:

1. Sending pull requests for bug fixes or new features and improvements
only in the **development branch**.
2. After a particular feature is completed it is merged into the master 
branch.
